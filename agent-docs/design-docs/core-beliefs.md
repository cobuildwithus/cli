# Core Beliefs

1. Keep command behavior predictable and explicit over clever implicit defaults.
2. Keep AGENTS route-oriented; move durable detail into `agent-docs/`.
3. Prefer stable API contracts and clear failure modes over convenience shortcuts.
4. Keep config and endpoint boundaries explicit so call paths remain auditable.
5. Treat execution plans and debt tracking as first-class maintenance artifacts.
